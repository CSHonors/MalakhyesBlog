        </div>
        <div class="text center">
          <p> The Vox article "America's unique gun violence problem, explained in 16 maps and charts", by German Lopez is an imformative genre article.
            The article is very effective in using logos with the evidence that it uses to convey its message. It uses sources credible coparations
            such as Small arms Suvery to prove his argument that America has a gun violence issue. Although a majority of Lopez source choices were well picked,
            some statistics that he uses don't support his over all argument such as how the majority of gun deaths are suicides. This doesn't really persuade
            the reader, but really leaves reader to come to their own conclusion.

          <h1> Sandy Hook Promise Video</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="text center">
          <p>The Sandy Hook Promise Video is a satrical genre making fun of back to school commercials with the purpose of persuading the audience into looking
            for the signs to prevent any futher school shootings. Its use of satire is very effective in creating a personal narrative, that being
            the children having to use their brand new school supplies to survive, making the video very persuasive. This stong pathos appeal to the viewers
            along with the call to action is what makes this video so effective in persuading its audience into their narrative. This is support my PhD. Kyrill A.
            Gooseff's journal "Only narratives can reflect the experience of objectivity: effective persuasio". Gooseff states that a personal narratives are important
            in getting a serious message across.
